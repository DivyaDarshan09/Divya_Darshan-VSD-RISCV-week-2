## Baby SoC Fundamentals & Functional Modeling

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to **Week 2** of the **20-Week RISC-V SoC Program by VSD**!  

After laying the foundation in Week 1, this week takes a step forward into the world of **System-on-Chip (SoC)**. The theme for Week 2 is all about building a **solid understanding of SoC fundamentals** and practicing **functional modeling** with the Baby SoC.

##  What This Week Covers
Week 2 is divided into two parts:

### Part 1 â€“ Conceptual Understanding
- Introduction to **System-on-Chip (SoC)**  
- Key components of a typical SoC:  
  - **CPU** â€“ the processing unit  
  - **Memory** â€“ instruction & data storage  
  - **Peripherals** â€“ external interfaces  
  - **Interconnect** â€“ the bus backbone connecting it all  
- Why the **Baby SoC** is an ideal simplified model for learning  
- Importance of **functional modeling** before RTL and physical design  

### Part 2 â€“ Hands-on Labs
- Simulating the Baby SoC using **Icarus Verilog**  
- Observing SoC behavior through **GTKWave**  
- Collecting **simulation logs**  
- Capturing **waveform screenshots** and explaining what each represents  

---

## Objective
By the end of Week 2, the goal is to:
- Understand the **building blocks of an SoC**  
- Recognize the role of the **Baby SoC** in learning design concepts  
- Practice **functional modeling** to validate correctness early in the design cycle  
- Get comfortable with **simulation tools** (Icarus Verilog + GTKWave)  

---

## Expected Outcomes
- A clear explanation of SoC fundamentals  
- Functional simulation of Baby SoC  
- **GTKWave screenshots** highlighting correct SoC behavior  
- Short explanations accompanying each result


---

##  Key Learnings
- An SoC is more than just a CPU â€“ itâ€™s the **integration of CPU, memory, peripherals, and interconnect**.  
- The **Baby SoC** helps break down complex SoC design into digestible parts.  
- **Functional modeling** is a must before RTL implementation and physical design.  
- Tools like **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave** are essential for early debugging and verification.
